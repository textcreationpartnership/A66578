            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> duty of every man in his <hi>reſpective</hi> place and calling, to endeavour to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his power, the preſervation and furtherance of true <hi>Religion,</hi> and the extirpation and aboliſhing of what ever is, or in probability may be, <hi>prejudicial</hi> thereunto. In <hi>conſideration</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance</hi> hereof, it is that I have penned this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> wherein I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured from the ſeveral <hi>Topicks</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> from which <hi>Divines</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly argue, to evince that all <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> things, by whomſoever brought into the <hi>Church,</hi> having been <hi>groſly</hi> abus'd to <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and by virtue thereof being apt to <hi>ſcandalize</hi> and <hi>offend,</hi> are for the neceſsary preſervation of the <hi>ſyncerity</hi> of Religion, the <hi>ſafety</hi> of mens Souls, and the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church,

Nay, <hi>ſome</hi> of the moſt able and zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of thoſe <hi>ſcandalous</hi> things we have amongst us, have found themſelves ſo <hi>perplex'd</hi> and <hi>tortur'd</hi> with this very <hi>Argument,</hi> that they have expreſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it, the <hi>chief</hi> weapon made uſe of againſt them. Which I urge not, as if I thought this <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſatisfie all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, touching the <hi>validity</hi> of it, but as that which I conceive may ſerve as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>expedient,</hi> to allay <hi>prejudice,</hi> and make way for a more <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106711:3"/>weighing of the caſe; which is all, that I can rationally either expect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. I ſhall never <hi>ſolicit</hi> men to cloſe with this, or any other <hi>Principle,</hi> till they are firſt <hi>convinced,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfied</hi> of the truth and juſtneſs of it. That we muſt cloſe with the <hi>will</hi> of God, when <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> to us, there is no <hi>queſtion;</hi> but then we muſt do it, in that <hi>method</hi> that he hath appointed, and in ſuch a <hi>way,</hi> as is agreeable to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of the faculties and powers he hath beſtowed on us. We must not <hi>firſt</hi> cloſe with a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> or <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> inquire into the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> of it (that's <hi>prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>) but we muſt <hi>firſt</hi> inquire into the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> of it, and then according as the <hi>reaſon</hi> attending it do's more or leſs <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> us, cloſe with it. So that he, who laying aſide <hi>prejudice,</hi> allows me a <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>fair</hi> audience in the preſent <hi>caſe,</hi> and cloſes with what I propound in a way proportionable to the <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> I offer to him, do's me all the right I can challenge from him. That this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath by men both of our own and other Nations, been heretofore urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Reliques</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:106711:4"/>Superſtition and Idolatry yet remaining in the <hi>Church,</hi> I readily grant; but by none that I know of, in ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>full</hi> a manner, as the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of it calls for. Thoſe who have gone the <hi>furtheſt,</hi> and ſaid the <hi>moſt</hi> of it, have left it in <hi>ſtraights</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under thoſe <hi>obſcurities</hi> and <hi>objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which their handling of it in a <hi>tranſient</hi> way, in the midſt of other <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> would not give them leave to deliver it from. Now theſe I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to <hi>meet</hi> with and endeavoured to <hi>diſpel</hi> and remove. I have conſulted <hi>Saravia, Dr. Burgeſs, Dr. Pridoaux, Dr. Hammond,</hi> with other of the beſt <hi>Authors</hi> that I know of, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt it, and peruſed their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi> and there is not any, if I am not much miſtaken, which I have not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered. If any upon their entring on the <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and reading the ſeveral <hi>particulars,</hi> which I contend upon their being abuſed ought to be laid aſide, think I expreſs my ſelf in too <hi>large</hi> and <hi>general</hi> terms, I deſire them to weigh the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>proofs</hi> alledg'd: and in caſe thoſe ſatisfie not, to ſuſpend their <hi>cenſure</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106711:4"/>till they come to the <hi>limitations,</hi> and the anſwering of the <hi>Objections;</hi> in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement whereof, I have endeavoured to restrain preceding expreſſions, that ſeem'd too <hi>full</hi> and <hi>large,</hi> to their juſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> (which I could not well do, before) and remov'd all <hi>ſcruples,</hi> and <hi>exceptions</hi> of any weight, that have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly,</hi> or otherwiſe, been taken up againſt the preſent <hi>truth.</hi> The diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it may undergo through the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi> of the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> in whoſe hands it is, to manage it in that <hi>exact</hi> way, wherein it ſhould be handled, muſt needs be great; however, upon ſerious <hi>inquiry</hi> into it, and impartial <hi>weighing</hi> of what I find is, or I conceive may be, alledg'd for, and againſt it, I am very confident, that being duely <hi>weilded</hi> and <hi>improved,</hi> it will afford <hi>ſufficient</hi> ſtrength to batter down all the <hi>fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> thoſe who <hi>preſide</hi> in the Church, or their Aſſiſtants, can erect in defence of thoſe <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> things which they do with ſo much <hi>zeal</hi> contend for, and with ſo much <hi>rigour</hi> impoſe on the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the begetting of moſt <hi>lamentable</hi>

Its not ſufficient that retaining the uſe of abuſed things, we ſeparate them from the abuſe. 3. <hi>Obj.</hi> urged by Dr. <hi>John Burgeſs,</hi> anſwered. Things that for the preſent have no bad uſe made of them, may in time, have. Whether <hi>Solomon</hi> did aboliſh the Idols he ſuffered to be ſet up in his life time, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did it, or whether it were done by <hi>Joſiah.

It does not follow from what hath been ſaid, that neceſſary things, being abuſed, are to be aboliſhed. 7. <hi>Obj.</hi> urged by Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> anſwered. The Scripture does not either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or indirectly hold forth to us a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of retaining abuſed, unneceſſary things. 8. <hi>Obj.</hi> made uſe of by Dr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

That you may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this, you are to note, that the ancient <hi>Patriachs,</hi> when neither <hi>Temple, Tabernacle,</hi> nor <hi>Synagogue</hi> was built, did by <hi>direction</hi> from God himſelf betake themſelves to ſuch <hi>places</hi> as theſe, to <hi>celebrate</hi> their Sacrifices, Prayers, Thankſgivings, Meditations, and ſuch like religious duties upon.

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the <hi>Perſon</hi> that was to kill and offer it, who was to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> only.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>And if we conſult the Antient <hi>Heathens,</hi> we ſhall find that they took the <hi>ſame</hi> courſe: they did not ſtand to build <hi>Temples</hi> as latter ages have done, but betaking themſelves to the open <hi>Mountains,</hi> they there celebrated their devotions to their reſpective <hi>Deityes.</hi> Nay, they did not only not build <hi>Temples,</hi> but thought it <hi>unlawful</hi> to do it; the reaſon whereof was probably this, That worſhiping the <hi>Sun,</hi> which they look'd upon as their <hi>chief</hi> God, they thought no <hi>Temple</hi> would compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: nay, they were ſo far from thinking they could build an Edifice <hi>ſuitable</hi> to it, that they accounted the <hi>whole</hi> world little enough to be a <hi>Temple</hi> for it.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106711:15"/>though in after-times they fell to the uſe of <hi>Temples,</hi> yet they ſtill had them upon <hi>high places,</hi> from whence their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> took their Names, as <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus, Mercurius Cyllenius, Venus Erycina,</hi> and the like. Whether the <hi>Heathens</hi> betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to theſe <hi>high places</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> in compliance with <hi>them,</hi> I ſhall not here inquire; <hi>certain</hi> it is that they both us'd them; and as <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> out of the zeal he bore to God, did ſo far as his Dominions extended <hi>remove</hi> them: which yet we are not to underſtand, as if he <hi>removed</hi> the <hi>Mouutains</hi> or <hi>Hills</hi> themſelves, but that he demoliſhed ſuch <hi>buildings</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> as were made upon them, for the carrying on of their Sacrifices, Oblations, and other Services there performed.

When a man would have thought he ſhould rather have found him in his <hi>Palace,</hi> congratulating himſelf in his Kingly <hi>dignity,</hi> feaſting with his <hi>Nobles,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the cheerful <hi>acclamations</hi> of his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, we have him in the <hi>Temple</hi> purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Fathers <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>idolatry:</hi> which holy <hi>speed</hi> renders his undertaking <hi>highly</hi> commendable. To have ſet upon ſuch a work only the <hi>firſt</hi> month of his reign, had been praiſe-worthy, but to do it the very day of his <hi>Coronation,</hi> is praiſe-worthy indeed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was a <hi>work</hi> that none, in many mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and weighty reſpects had ingag'd in <hi>before</hi> him. <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat,</hi>

               <p>You ſee then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had many and great <hi>impediments</hi> to this holy undertaking. His Father (whom in regard of his natural <hi>deſcent</hi> from him, he could not chooſe but reverence) had followed ſtrange Gods all his days; the <hi>Kingdom</hi> had generally complyed with him; the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> their near Neighbours and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106711:22"/>had not only <hi>given</hi> themſelves to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but had <hi>continued</hi> in it ſo long that they could plead <hi>preſcription: Hezekiah</hi> himſelf was a <hi>young</hi> man, in the prime and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his youth, and ſo likelier to be carried away after <hi>pleaſures,</hi> than to mind matters of <hi>religion;</hi> and which is none of the leaſt, the work he was to undertake, was ſuch in divers reſpects, as none of his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> how wiſe or good ſoever, had <hi>ingaged</hi> in.

Thus much I thought good to ſuggeſt ere I went any farther, to ſhew the <hi>difficulties</hi> and <hi>diſcouragements</hi> that attended this work, and how eminently <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> zeal brake forth in the undertaking and management of it.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106711:33"/>a man, but from</hi> Romulus, <hi>which certainly is the cauſe that many take ſuch liberty in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. What muſt our Temples every where be Sanctuaries to ſuch as theſe? how contrary is this to the inſtitution of</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that which he thus ſeriouſly <hi>bewailes</hi> and <hi>declaims</hi> againſt, divers Chriſtian <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> being affected with, have wholly aboliſhed all <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> for offenders whatſoever, and <hi>laid</hi> them aſide, chooſing rather to run the hazard of ſome <hi>leſſer</hi> inconveniencies in the want of them, than ſuch <hi>great</hi> ones, in the uſe of them,</p>
               <p>And thus I have made good what I affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> hath not only thought-fit to <hi>lay aſide</hi> ſuch things as have been <hi>abuſed</hi> in Idolatry, but likewiſe ſuch as have been <hi>abus'd</hi> in proceedings of a <hi>lower</hi> nature; which I have inſiſted on, for this <hi>end,</hi> to ſhew that if ſuch things are to be laid aſide, then thoſe that have been <hi>abus'd</hi> the <hi>former</hi> way, and ſo have receiv'd defilement of a <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>worſe</hi> die, are much more. <hi>Idolatry</hi> do's not only argue a <hi>neglect</hi> of God, but ſets up a <hi>rival</hi> or <hi>competitor</hi> with him, nay <hi>prefers</hi> another before him; and therefore though <hi>all</hi> ſins are offenſive and provoking, yet <hi>that</hi> is is ſo in an <hi>eſpecial</hi> manner: whence it follows, that of <hi>all</hi> thoſe things which have been <hi>abuſed</hi> thoſe are moſt offenſive which have been <hi>abus'd</hi> in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and therefore of all others ought to be laid aſide.

               <p>Perhaps you'l ſay, If it were indeed the pleaſure of God, that ſuch as corrupted his <hi>worſhip,</hi> and committed <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſhould be cut off, how as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not deſtroy the <hi>Jews,</hi> when as they burnt <hi>incenſe</hi> to the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Serpent?

Perhaps the <hi>number</hi> of thoſe who had an hand therein was ſo <hi>great,</hi> that he could not, without deſtroying the <hi>body</hi> of the people (which in likelihood would have been a task too difficult for him) do it. It's ſaid in the Text, that the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106711:37"/>did burn <hi>incenſe</hi> to it; that is, (according to an uſual <hi>figure,</hi> whereby we put the greater part for the whole) the <hi>generality</hi> of them; of all which to have attempted the puniſhment the <hi>Law</hi> required, would have been a buſineſs of <hi>dangerous</hi> conſequence. 2. How does it appear that he did not (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did before him) cut off the <hi>principal</hi> offenders? Though we may argue from Scripture <hi>Negatively</hi> in matters of <hi>faith,</hi> yet not in matters of <hi>fact.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath omitted the relating of many things, which he judg'd <hi>unneceſſary</hi> for us to know, and who can ſay but it is ſo in this <hi>caſe?</hi> As I cannot ſay he <hi>did</hi> deſtroy them, ſo neither can he that ſhall oppoſe me ſay he did <hi>not.</hi> 3. Admit he did not do it, how will it appear he did not <hi>ſin</hi> in it? we ſee what the Law required, and what others (ſome of which were <hi>divinely inſpired</hi>) practiſed; and that muſt needs be a ſtronger evidence for the puniſhing of <hi>Idolaters</hi> with death, than <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> omiſſion, whereof we are yet uncertain is for the <hi>ſparing</hi> of them.</p>

However, to prove here that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> both <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to perform all theſe particulars, is more than the <hi>orderly</hi> proſecution of my preſent <hi>theme</hi> does require. It is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for me in this place, to make good that <hi>branch</hi> of the laſt <hi>particular</hi> which concerns the <hi>removal</hi> of ſuch things as have been <hi>abus'd</hi> in <hi>ſuperstitious</hi> and <hi>idolatrous</hi> ſervices; and that I ſhall <hi>endeavour</hi> to do, in theſe following <hi>particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God in <hi>Scripture</hi> gives the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſuch <hi>appellations,</hi> and <hi>titles,</hi> as ſhew he ought to do it. He ſtiles him <hi>Shepherd, Father,</hi> and the like; and that not only as to the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> over which he is, but as to the <hi>Church</hi> within his Dominions. Now though we muſt not ſtretch <hi>metaphors</hi> too far, yet this we may <hi>ſafely</hi> conclude, that as <hi>Shepherds, Fathers,</hi> and ſuch like relations are to <hi>provide</hi> Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for their <hi>flocks, children,</hi> and thoſe who are under their charge, and <hi>remove</hi> ſtumbling blocks, and whatever may be hurtfull to them; ſo <hi>Magistrates</hi> are to provide <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> over which they are, and <hi>remove</hi> ſuch things as have been <hi>abusd</hi> in <hi>corrupt</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and whatever <hi>elſe</hi> they meet with that tends to <hi>infect,</hi> or <hi>inſnare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He charges the puniſhing, ſuppreſſing,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106711:56"/>and purging of Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, in a <hi>peculiar</hi> manner upon him.<note place="margin">

And ſo the meaning is, that it was a time of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and confuſion, wherein the people having no better guide than their own corrupt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious

               <p n="5">5. He is ſo far from being diſpleas'd with them for ingaging in ſuch matters, that he is <hi>offended</hi> with them that they proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>blames</hi> them for it. He reproves <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Azariah,</hi> that when they threw down the <hi>Idols,</hi> which they found in the land, they did not with them deſtroy the <hi>high places,</hi> but ſuffered them to <hi>remain,</hi> and the people to <hi>burn</hi> incenſe in them. Here <hi>two exceptions</hi> are made: 1. It's ſaid, that what is alledged from theſe <hi>instances,</hi> concerns the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were <hi>types</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore though they <hi>had,</hi> and <hi>exerciſed</hi> ſuch a power, it does not follow, eſpecially now, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being come, that others may do it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Divers of the forecited places did not only concern the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as it was a <hi>divided</hi> State, but alſo the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106711:57"/>Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> Kings and Princes whatſoever. Not only the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> but the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and other foreign Princes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezr.</hi> 5.13.6.1. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.8</note> ſuch as <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes,</hi> did as much in the matter of Religion, as the thing in the preſent diſcourſe amounts to, and yet the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is ſo far from blaming them, that he <hi>records</hi> it to their praiſe, and <hi>commends</hi> them for it. 2. How does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were <hi>types</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> It does not follow that becauſe they were his <hi>predeceſſors,</hi> or bore ſome <hi>reſemblance</hi> of him, that therefore they were <hi>types</hi> of him. 3. Admit that in ſome reſpects they were <hi>types</hi> of him, yet that in it <hi>ſelf</hi> without divine <hi>commiſſion,</hi> could not <hi>impower</hi> them to do any more, than thoſe who were no <hi>types</hi> at all of him. It is not the being <hi>types,</hi> but the having a <hi>command,</hi> that inveſts men with power to undertake and perform ſervices. But 2. It's further ſaid, that the condition of Kings, in the Old Teſtament, was different from what it is now. They had <hi>Prophets</hi> to adviſe with, and receive directions from, which in theſe dayes they have not. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ſo far in Religious matters, was not from hence that they had <hi>Prophets</hi> to conſult with,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.24. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.40.30.16.31.3, 21</note> but from this, that the <hi>Law</hi> required them to do it, the <hi>directions</hi> whereof they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any particular <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Though they had <hi>Prophets</hi> by them, nay though ſome of them were <hi>Prophets</hi> themſelves, yet unleſs it were in ſome <hi>ſpecial,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106711:57"/>extraordinary caſes they kept to the <hi>Law,</hi> and followed the directions thereof. 2. What is here objected againſt the <hi>power</hi> of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> may alſo be objected againſt the power of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> concerning whom it may as well be ſaid, that they had <hi>Prophets</hi> to adviſe with, and that therefore what they did in reforming the Church, is of no force to us. Which <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> I know will be thought <hi>unſound</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and yet if we admit the <hi>former,</hi> I ſee not how we can withſtand it. Will it be ſaid, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had a ſtanding Law, to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize and warrant their proceedings? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> ſo had the <hi>Magistrate</hi> as well as they. Or will it be ſaid, that that <hi>Law</hi> was granted to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> with whom he was to adviſe: What hinders but I may ſay the like of the <hi>Prieſts?</hi> Theſe <hi>Exceptions</hi> being thus removed out of the way, I ſhall go on with my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Church</hi> of God hath all along ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and taught, that this work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> and thereupon hath ſtill as there hath been <hi>occaſion</hi> and <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

But, 2.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106711:78"/>all that will not be yeilded to; for though it cannot be denied, that much of the ſtrength of this <hi>diſcourſe</hi> is taken from thoſe precepts God delivered to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> touching the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> yet withall it is to be noted that thoſe precepts were not of a meer <hi>poſitive</hi> nature, intended only to direct the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the extirpation of the <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> idolatry, as is ſuggeſted, but in the extirpation of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of their own <hi>Nation,</hi> or any other <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>people,</hi> over whom they ſhould have dominion. This appears ſeveral ways. 1. The <hi>reaſons</hi> on which thoſe <hi>precepts</hi> are founded are <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>common;</hi> and therefore the <hi>precepts</hi> themſelves muſt be ſo; for where the <hi>reaſon</hi> of a <hi>precept</hi> is <hi>common,</hi> the precept it ſelf is ſo, except the <hi>authority</hi> whence it comes, do ſome way or other <hi>limit</hi> it. Now that the <hi>reaſons</hi> on which theſe <hi>precepts</hi> be founded, are <hi>common,</hi> is evident. God would have the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſtroy the <hi>monuments</hi> of the <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> idolatry, becauſe they were an <hi>abomination</hi> to him, and that they might not be <hi>ſnares</hi> to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what is there in theſe <hi>reaſons,</hi> but what is <hi>common</hi> to all <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi> of idolatry whatſoever? 2. What the pious Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> did in the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only of the <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> idolatry, but all other idolatry whatſoever, they did it in purſuance of theſe <hi>precepts.

The <hi>method</hi> of Chriſtian Churches in aboliſhing abuſed things, ſhews they did not only hold that the ſame <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> thing which had been abuſed ought to be aboliſhed, but alſo others of the ſame <hi>ſort,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106711:87"/>though never ſtained with any miſcarriage whatever. Obſerving (as you heard before) the abuſe attending the office of the <hi>Shriving</hi> Prieſt, they did not only remove the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>perſon</hi> that had offended, but the <hi>office</hi> it ſelf; and obſerving likewiſe the abuſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Religious <hi>Orders,</hi> they did not only appear againſt the particular <hi>perſons</hi> that had tranſgreſſed, but put down the <hi>Orders</hi> themſelves. 4. The <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Objection</hi> himſelf, a little before, even in the preceding <hi>page,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Croſs</hi> hath been a laudable <hi>rite,</hi> and very <hi>antient</hi> in the Church of Chriſt; from which he endeavours to juſtifie the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> uſe of it. Now I would know what <hi>Croſs</hi> it is that hath been ſuch a laudable <hi>rite,</hi> and ſo <hi>antient</hi> in the Church. Does he mean the ſame <hi>individual</hi> Croſs that we uſe every day? No, that he cannot, for that receives its birth the very <hi>inſtant</hi> wherein it is made. What then does he mean? why, only the ſame in <hi>kind;</hi> and if we may argue from the <hi>uſe</hi> of ſome to the <hi>uſe</hi> of others of the ſame <hi>kind,</hi> why may we not argue from the <hi>abuſe</hi> of ſome, to the <hi>aboliſhing</hi> of others of the ſame <hi>kind?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> heretofore thought we might, and therefore (as I have before told you) renders this as the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> reaſon of the aboliſhing of divers things upon the <hi>Reformation</hi> laid aſide, that they had been ſo far <hi>abuſed;</hi> which I do much wonder this great <hi>Doctor,</hi> whiles he is writing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (to which that <hi>paſſage</hi> is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106711:88"/>prefix'd) ſhould ſo far injure both the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>himſelf,</hi> as not to remember. And then, 5. As for what he alledges concerning the burning of all <hi>trees,</hi> becauſe of the abuſe of <hi>one</hi> tree, or <hi>one</hi> grove, is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs he had made it appear, that there was never above <hi>one</hi> Croſs abuſed, or at leaſt that it hath been far leſs <hi>abuſed,</hi> than law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>uſed;</hi> whereas he could not but know, that it hath been a <hi>thouſand</hi> times over more <hi>abuſed,</hi> than it either <hi>hath,</hi> or is ever <hi>like</hi> to be lawfully <hi>uſed;</hi> admitting that <hi>uſe</hi> which he himſelf here pleads for, in <hi>England,</hi> were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Let the <hi>caſe</hi> be but rightly ſtated, and I am content to ſtand to this <hi>instance.</hi> Suppoſe then, 1. that all trees were <hi>indifferent,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>needleſs</hi> things, as the <hi>croſs</hi> and other <hi>ceremonies</hi> are confeſs'd to be. 2. That for <hi>one</hi> time they were rightly <hi>uſed,</hi> they were a <hi>thouſand</hi> times <hi>abuſed,</hi> as every one knows the <hi>croſs</hi> is, that underſtands what an <hi>Idol</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make of it; whether would it not be our duty (as the <hi>Doctor</hi> here ſaith) to <hi>burn</hi> them every one, and ſo prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that otherwiſe would be committed by them? I think there is not any man truly <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>zealous,</hi> but would ſubſcribe to the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.</hi> Sure I am ſuch was the ſpirit of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that though the brazen <hi>Serpent</hi> was of higher <hi>original,</hi> more <hi>profitable</hi> uſe than the <hi>croſs</hi> can be pretended to be, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſo much <hi>abuſed</hi> as the <hi>croſs</hi> hath been, yet he took it and brake it in pieces.</p>

               <p>But you'l ſay, may we not at all appear before an <hi>Idol,</hi> or be preſent at <hi>idolatrous</hi> worſhip? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, we may; but then we muſt ſee, 1.

We muſt ſee that we have <hi>ſenſes</hi> capable of diſcerning betwixt <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> that we have <hi>strength</hi> to encounter with a <hi>temptation;</hi> that we are able to ſtand out againſt the <hi>allurements</hi> of gliſtering and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous <hi>vanities.</hi> And hereof, we are to have good <hi>aſſurance:</hi> otherwiſe we muſt forbear. Many <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> men have been inſnar'd, and therefore we had beſt beware how we venture. 2. That we do it, not <hi>raſhly,</hi> or of our own heads, but have a <hi>call</hi> from God for it. We muſt keep the <hi>places</hi> and <hi>ſtations</hi> we ſupply, and not depart from them. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Origen</hi> is well known; Hearing of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106711:95"/>ſome <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that under the Perſecution by <hi>Decius,</hi> were carried to an <hi>Idols</hi> Temple, to be intic'd to <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> out of an <hi>indiſcreet</hi> zeal ran to them, and being urged to it himſelf, unhappily, and ſinfully <hi>yielded;</hi> whereby he made ſuch a <hi>wound</hi> in his <hi>conſcience,</hi> as he could not get cured of a long time.
